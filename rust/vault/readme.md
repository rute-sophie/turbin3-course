# Vault

This is code from turbin3 live classes where we learn how to create and interact with a vault on Solana.

It contains vault program initialization, vault deposit function (uses CPI to transfer funds from signer to vault),
vault withdraw function (transfers funds back from vault to signer), vault close function (close the vault and transfer all funds to signer).
