# AMM

An AMM (Automated Market Maker) in Solana is a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade tokens without the need for a traditional order book. Instead of buyers and sellers placing orders, trades are executed through liquidity pools using smart contracts.

This is a turbin3 class code exercise.
